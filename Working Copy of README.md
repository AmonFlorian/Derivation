Derivation Resource Pack
======

![derivation](http://i.imgur.com/EmB4Jia.png "Derivation")

This will be a reboot, partial remix of the Derivation texture pack for Minecraft. It has been created by Levaunt back in 2011 and was abandoned in 2014 with specific permission to be picked up/used by anyone who wants to. JetStorm was the one picking up the torch and updated it with the help of anew742, Imonobor and others, but abandoned it in 2016 due to real life issues. I has been picked up by the Eclipse Team in early 2017 with the goal of making it a thriving community project, just like they did with the Sphax pack back in the days..
